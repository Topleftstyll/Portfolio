					<p class="gameparagraph">
						Ballz arena is a game idea I pretty much stole from Brackeys the youtuber. He made it for a game jam but he never released the code or atleast I never tried to look for it.
						When I saw his game I thought it would be fun to try and remake it for myself and add some things onto it.
					</p>

					<p class="gameparagraph">
						Ballz Arena is a game I made for fun in Unity with a bit of help from a classmate. The game is basically Super Smash Bros but you shoot each other instead of fist fighting.
						Ballz Arena is a fully networked 1v1 match with the objective to knock each other off the map.
