					<p class="gameparagraph">
						The Spot is a nostalgic package of retro styled games inspired by classics we all know and love. The player is able to enter an arcade,The Spot, which offers the choice of four tempting games to play: Rabbit Racing, Lazer Tron, Blood Sport, and Undead Defender.
					</p>

					<p class="gameparagraph">
						For this Unity project my class of about 30 students split into groups of 4-5 for each of the arcade games inside. I was the team lead of BloodSport and also on the networking team which did the networkign for all the games. My job on BloobSport was to make the warrior and also do the networking for the game.
