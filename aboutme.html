						Hi my name is Joshua Brackett I'm 22 years old and currently enrolled at triOS College for Video Game Design + Development. My expected date to graduate is August 1st 2018. A little about myself? I started out coding in early high school around 15 years old using java. I loved the problem solving using the different possible solutions to solve 1 single problem. After I finished my first year of coding in class I decided to self teach my self some other languages so the next language I learned was HTML, I was young and that happened to be the first to pop up on Google. I used CodeCademy to self teach my self HTML/CSS/JavaScript then decided I wanted a career doing stuff like that so I started at Canadian Business College for Software Engineering. I graduated from there in July 2016 and soon realized that course wasn't what I wanted I wanted to solve complex problems. So my friend told me about a College he went to that taught him about video games and that he struggles with solving problems all the time and I thought that was perfect for me. About 3 weeks later started at TriOS College and have loved making video games since.
